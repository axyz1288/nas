# ðŸ§  Random Neural Architecture Search (RNAS)

This repository introduces **Random Neural Architecture Search (RNAS)** â€” a novel approach to generating diverse neural network architectures **randomly**, unlike traditional NAS methods that rely on manually defined blocks and fixed connection patterns.

RNAS aims to explore a wider architectural space by leveraging randomness, promoting diversity, and potentially discovering innovative model structures that may be overlooked by conventional design strategies.

## ðŸš§ Upcoming Features

- Code to reproduce the architectures  
- Visualization tools  
- Benchmarking results  
- Integration with training pipelines
